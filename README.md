# Week-9-Project-Pentesting-Live-Targets
# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: 4 hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: SQL Injection
* I added the line % OR 1 = 1 % and it adds it to the bottom of the site. THe site in not sanitized properly.

Vulnerability #2: Session Hijacking
* If the Session of another person login is exposed if taken can login without knowing your credentials. 
* Usually sites expire a session after a set period of time.

## Green

Vulnerability #1: XSS

Vulnerability #2: User Enumeration 
* You can see that the difference between whether someone is in the system or if they exist
* An actually user is bold and if not its regular font

## Red

Vulnerability #1: Insecure Direct Object Refrence
* By changing the parameter in the url, I am able to view information that should not be exposed

Vulnerability #2: CSRF 
* Usually CSRF is needed to validate the data being posted but in this case I am able to edit the data with random validation

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while doing the work

For the Session Hijacking I could not figure out a quick way to get the session id. Then I remembered there was a hacking tool that allowed us to change it easily. Everything else was just trial and error.
